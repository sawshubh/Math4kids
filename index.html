            <h1>What is Math or Mathematics?</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="definition">
                Mathematics, or math, is the study of numbers and how they are related to each other and to the real world. Math is as important as language. In fact, people sometimes describe math as a kind of language. Everyone uses math every day—to tell time, to play games, to cook, to build things, and to do almost any kind of work.

            <h1>Importance of Mathematics</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="important">Maths is the basic foundation for almost every field. Imagine you want to count how much run does the batsmen make or how much goal footballers score in each game. Without Math it is impossible to count.Making the base of Mathematics strong means making your future self to solve more tough problems unlike the guy in the video who is graduated and does'nt know how to calculate numbers. OHHH.... such a disappointment...!

                <p class="subtraction">
                    In math, to subtract means to take away from a group or a number of things. 
                    When we subtract, the number of things in the group reduce or become less.
                    The minuend, subtrahend and difference are parts of a subtraction problem.
                    In the subtraction problem, 7 – 3 = 4, the number 7 is the minuend, the number 
                    3 is the subtrahend and the number 4 is the difference.

                <h1>3. Multiplication</h1>
                <p class="multiplication">
                    In math, to multiply means to add equal groups. 
                    When we multiply, the number of things in the group increases.
                    The two factors and the product are parts of a multiplication problem. 
                    In the multiplication problem, 6 × 9 = 54, the numbers 6 and 9 are the factors, while the number 54 is the product.

                <h1>4. Division</h1>  
                <p class="division">
                    The division is a method of distributing a group of things into equal parts. It is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, which gives a fair result of sharing. 
                    The division is an operation inverse of multiplication. If 3 groups of 4 make 12 in multiplication; 12 divided into 3 equal groups give 4 in each group in division.
                    The main goal of the division is to see how many equal groups or how many in each group when sharing fairly.
                    For example: There are 16 balls and 4 boxes, how to put 16 balls into four equal sized boxes?
